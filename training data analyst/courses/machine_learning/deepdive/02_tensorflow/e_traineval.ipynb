This causes an evaluation to be done after every training checkpoint. However by default Tensorflow only checkpoints once every  10 minutes. Since this is less than the length of our total training we'd end up with the same behavior as before which is just one evaluation at the end of training. \n",

[`tf.contrib.estimator.add_metrics()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/estimator/add_metrics) allows us to do this. We wrap our estimator with it, and provide a custom evaluation function.\n",
