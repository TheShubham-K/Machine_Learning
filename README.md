This repo is a playground for various data science operations that one may want to implement. Anything from basic data manipulation operations to complex algortithms can be implemented here. 

## How to contribute
If you wish to contribute, please submit a pull request stating the additions you would like to make to the repository and category of code your Jupyter notebook deals with  - **Data Analysis**, **Supervised Learning**, **Unsupervised Learning** or **Reinforcement Learning** and mention the dataset you have worked with. If the data is not available as an API call, please include a copy of the data or a link to obtain the same.

* Along with this, please create a new directory under the respective area you want to contribute to. 
* For example: If you wish to contribute your work on the Iris dataset under the domain **Supervised Learning**, create a directory with a name like ``` supervised_learning_iris``` or a specific algorithm you wish to apply in the ```supervised_learning``` directory.
* Let the commit message include the domain as well as the dataset you are working with.<br>

**Please work with Jupyter notebooks and maintain some documentation on what your code does.** :innocent:
